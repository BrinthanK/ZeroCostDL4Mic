This network allows image reconstruction of 2D super-resolution images, in a supervised training manner. The network is traiend using simulated high-density SMLM data for which the ground-truth is available. These simulations are obtained from random distribution of single molecules in a field-of-view and therefore do not imprint structural priors duting training.
