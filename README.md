# ZeroCostDL4Mic: A Google Colab based no-cost toolbox to explore Deep-Learning in Microscopy

_**Tl;dr**_: the [**wiki page**][wikiPage] of the this project has everything you need to get started.

## What is this

ZeroCostDL4Mic is a collection of self-explanatory Jupyter Notebooks for [**Google Colab**][1] that feature an easy-to-use graphical user interface. They are meant to quickly get you started learning to use deep-learning for microscopy. Google Colab itself provides at no-cost the computations resources needed. **ZeroCostDL4Mic** is designed for researchers that have little or no coding expertise to quickly test, train and use popular DL networks.

## Who is it for

Any researcher interested in microscopy, independent of their background training. **ZeroCostDL4Mi**c is designed for anyone with little or no coding expertise to quickly test, train and use popular Deep-Learning networks used to process microscopy data.

## Acknowledgements

While this project is lead by a collaboration between the [**Jacquemet**][6] and [**Henriques**][5] laboratories, there is a long list of contributors associated with the project acknowledged in a preprint soon to be released and in the [**wiki page**][wikiPage].
