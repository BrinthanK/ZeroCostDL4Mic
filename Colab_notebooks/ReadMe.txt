ZeroCostDL4Mic is a toolbox for the training and implementation of common Deep Learning approaches to microscopy imaging. It exploits the ease-of-use and access to GPU provided by Google Colab. Training data can be uploaded to the Google Drive from where it can be used to train models using the provided Colab notebooks in a web-browser. Predictions on unseen data can then be performed within the same notebook, therefore not requiring any local hardware or software set-up.

More information about the use of ZeroCostDL4Mic can be found in the enclosed Manual or in our wiki page:

1. System requirements

Our notebooks are Jupiter notebooks optimised to run in Google Colab :

No specialised hardware or software is required as everything runs on the cloud. All that is needed is an up-to-date web browser. 
While not strictly required, we recommend the users to use a Google account to login into Google Colab and use our notebook. This will allow them to upload and store data in Google Drive. More information is available in the ZeroCostDL4Mic Manual or our Wiki pages.

2. Installation guide

To start using ZeroCostDL4Mic, you can either:
	- upload the notebook(s) directly in Google Colab
	- Click on the links available in our wiki pages

More information is available in the Manual. A step-by-step video is also available here:
