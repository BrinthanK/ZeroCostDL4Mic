Inspection of the loss function**\n","---\n","\n","<font size = 4>First, it is good practice to evaluate the training progress by comparing the training loss with the validation loss. The latter is a metric which shows how well the network performs on a subset of unseen data which is set aside from the training dataset. For more information on this, see for example [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6381354/) by Nichols *et al.*\n","\n","<font size = 4>**Training loss** describes an error value after each epoch for the difference between the model's prediction and its ground-truth target.\n","\n","<font size = 4>**Validation loss** describes the same error value between the model's prediction on a validation image and compared to it's target.\n","\n","<font size = 4>During training both values should decrease before reaching a minimal value which does not decrease further even after more training. Comparing the development of the validation loss with the training loss can give insights into the model's performance.\n","\n","<font size = 4>Decreasing **Training loss** and **Validation loss** indicates that training is still necessary and increasing the `number_of_epochs` is recommended. Note that the curves can look flat towards the right side, just because of the y-axis scaling. The network has reached convergence once the curves flatten out. After this point no further training is required. If the **Validation loss** suddenly increases again an the **Training loss** simultaneously goes towards zero, it means that the network is overfitting to the training data. In other words the network is remembering the exact patterns from the training data and no longer generalizes well to unseen data. In this case the training dataset has to be increased.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KG8wZrA3Ef4n","colab_type":"code","cellView":"form","colab":{}},"source":["#@markdown ##Play the cell to show a plot of training errors vs. epoch number\n","\n","lossDataFromCSV = []\n","vallossDataFromCSV = []\n","\n","with open(QC_model_path+'/'+QC_model_name+'/Quality Control/training_evaluation.csv','r') as csvfile:\n","    csvRead = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')\n","    next(csvRead)\n","    for row in csvRead:\n","        lossDataFromCSV.append(float(row[0]))\n","        vallossDataFromCSV.append(float(row[1]))\n","\n","epochNumber = range(len(lossDataFromCSV))\n","plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n","\n","plt.subplot(2,1,1)\n","plt.plot(epochNumber,lossDataFromCSV, label='Training loss')\n","plt.plot(epochNumber,vallossDataFromCSV, label='Validation loss')\n","plt.title('Training loss and validation loss vs. epoch number (linear scale)')\n","plt.ylabel('Loss')\n","plt.xlabel('Epoch number')\n","plt.legend()\n","\n","plt.subplot(2,1,2)\n","plt.semilogy(epochNumber,lossDataFromCSV, label='Training loss')\n","plt.semilogy(epochNumber,vallossDataFromCSV, label='Validation loss')\n","plt.title('Training loss and validation loss vs. epoch number (log scale)')\n","plt.ylabel('Loss')\n","plt.xlabel('Epoch number')\n","plt.legend()\n","plt.savefig(QC_model_path+'/'+QC_model_name+'/Quality Control/lossCurvePlots.png')\n","plt.show()\n","\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GFJBwr5TEgcq","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## **5.2.
