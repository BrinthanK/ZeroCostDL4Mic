This is based on the original [YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) implementation published by the same authors. YOLOv2 is trained on images with class annotations in the form of bounding boxes drawn around the objects of interest. The images are downsampled by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and objects are classified in two final fully connected layers in the network. YOLOv2 learns classification and object detection simultaneously by taking the whole input image into account, predicting many possible bounding box solutions, and then using regression to find the best bounding boxes and classifications for each object.\n","\n","<font size = 4>**This particular notebook enables object detection and classification on 2D images given ground truth bounding boxes.
