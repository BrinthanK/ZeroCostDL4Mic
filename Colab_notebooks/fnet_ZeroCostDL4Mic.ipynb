The network is trained using paired training images from the same field of view, imaged in a label-free (e.g. brightfield) and labelled condition (e.g. fluorescent protein). When trained, this allows the user to identify certain structures from brightfield images alone. The performance of fnet may depend significantly on the structure at hand."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BFBT1oeyHSS-","colab_type":"text"},"source":["---\n","<font size = 4> *Disclaimer*:\n","\n","<font size = 4> This notebook is part of the Zero-Cost Deep-Learning to Enhance Microscopy project (https://github.com/HenriquesLab/DeepLearning_Collab/wiki).
